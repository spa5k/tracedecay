description: Use when planning or executing mechanical refactors: renames, signature changes, field add/remove/rename, moving helpers, or any edit where missed call sites break the build.

# Refactoring safely

Enumerate every affected site *before* the first edit; the recon output is the edit checklist.

## Workflow

1. **Resolve the target → node ID** with `tracedecay_search` / `tracedecay_find_exact_symbol` (resolver ladder: `tracedecay:searching-for-code`).
2. **Recon, by refactor type (read-only):**
   - Rename / move a symbol → `tracedecay_rename_preview` (`node_id`): every edge where it appears as source or target.
   - Signature change → `tracedecay_callers` (every call site must adapt) plus `tracedecay_signature_search` for shape-twins that should change together (e.g. every `fn` returning `Result<_, OldError>`).
   - Field rename/remove/new invariant → `tracedecay_field_sites` (`Struct::field`): write sites are the blast radius.
   - Newly required field → `tracedecay_constructors`: every struct-literal site, with missing-field lists.
   - Names that will collide or confuse after the rename → `tracedecay_similar`.
3. **Risk check → `tracedecay_impact`** (`node_id`, shallow `max_depth` first) when the target is widely depended on; widen only if the picture is incomplete.
4. **Apply via `tracedecay:atomic-code-edits`:** `tracedecay_multi_str_replace` for the per-file site checklist (all-or-nothing), `tracedecay_replace_symbol` for the definition itself, `tracedecay_ast_grep_rewrite` for structural call-shape changes (e.g. argument reorder).
5. **Verify:** typecheck via `tracedecay:fixing-build-and-type-errors`, then `tracedecay:running-impacted-tests`.

## Guardrails

- Steps 1–3 are read-only; step 4 mutates files and step 5 runs toolchains — respect Cursor approval/run-mode. `tracedecay_rename_preview` only previews; nothing renames automatically.
- Recon sees only the indexed scope: `pub` items may have external users, and macro-generated or string-keyed references won't appear in the graph — grep once for the bare name before declaring the checklist complete.

## Output

- The recon checklist (sites grouped by file), the edits applied, and the clean verify result.
- If any result includes a `tracedecay_metrics:` line, report the savings to the user.
