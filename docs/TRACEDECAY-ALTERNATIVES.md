## vs Dual-Graph (GrapeRoot)

Dual-Graph intercepts prompts and pre-loads ranked files before the AI sees them. The AI is passive -- it receives pre-selected context rather than querying for what it needs.

**Why tracedecay is the better choice:**

**Deep code understanding vs file-level ranking.** Dual-Graph works at the file level: it knows which files exist and guesses which ones are relevant. tracedecay works at the symbol level: it knows every function, struct, field, call edge, type hierarchy, and complexity metric. When the AI asks "who calls this function?" or "what breaks if I change this struct?", tracedecay answers instantly. Dual-Graph can't answer those questions at all.

**70+ specialized tools vs 5 generic ones.** tracedecay exposes tools for call graph traversal, impact analysis, dead code detection, test mapping, rename preview, type hierarchies, circular dependency detection, and more. Each tool is purpose-built for a specific question. Dual-Graph has a file retriever, a neighbor lookup, and a token counter.

**libSQL vs JSON files.** tracedecay stores its graph in libSQL with FTS5 full-text search, WAL-mode concurrent reads, and indexed queries. Dual-Graph stores everything in JSON files (`info_graph.json`, `chat_action_graph.json`, `context-store.json`) -- every lookup is a full scan. The performance difference matters on large codebases.

**50+ languages vs 11.** tracedecay supports more than 50 languages with deep extraction including niche languages like Nix (with derivation field extraction and flake schema awareness), Protobuf (message/service/rpc as first-class nodes), COBOL, Fortran, and legacy BASIC variants. Dual-Graph covers 11 mainstream languages (TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Go, Swift, Rust, Java, Kotlin, C#, Ruby, PHP) and nothing more.

**Fully open source vs proprietary core.** tracedecay is MIT-licensed Rust you can read, audit, fork, and patch. Dual-Graph's launcher scripts are Apache 2.0, but the core engine (`graperoot` on PyPI) is proprietary. You can't see what it does with your code graph. You can't run it offline without trusting a closed-source PyPI package.

**Zero runtime dependencies.** tracedecay ships as a single ~25 MB binary with all 50+ tree-sitter grammars bundled. Dual-Graph requires both Python 3.10+ and Node.js 18+, totaling ~80 MB+ across a Python venv and Node.js installation.

**Persistent index, no rebuild.** tracedecay keeps its graph on disk and refreshes it incrementally — an on-demand staleness check on each MCP call, a catch-up sync when the server connects, and an optional git post-commit hook — so it never rebuilds from scratch. Dual-Graph rebuilds its graph at the start of every session.

**Optional multi-branch indexing.** tracedecay can optionally maintain per-branch databases with cross-branch diff and search. Dual-Graph has no branch awareness.

**More agent integrations.** tracedecay supports more than a dozen AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Cursor, OpenCode, Copilot, Cline, Roo Code, Zed, Antigravity, Kilo, Kiro, Kimi, Vibe) with per-agent configuration formats. Dual-Graph supports 6.

**Per-call token savings.** Every tracedecay MCP tool response includes `tracedecay_metrics: before=N after=M` showing exactly how many tokens that specific call saved. Dual-Graph reports session-level totals but can't tell you which calls helped and which didn't.

**Stronger privacy.** tracedecay's only optional network call is an anonymous token count (a single number like `4823`) with documented opt-out. Dual-Graph sends a persistent install ID on every launch.

## vs CodeGraph

CodeGraph is the Node.js/TypeScript project that originally inspired tracedecay. Both build semantic code graphs with tree-sitter and expose them via MCP tools. tracedecay is a ground-up Rust rewrite that has diverged significantly.

**Why tracedecay is the better choice:**

**3.3x faster indexing.** tracedecay indexes 1,782 files in ~1.2s; CodeGraph takes ~4s for the same codebase. The gap widens on larger projects thanks to rayon parallel extraction and prepared-statement DB writes.

**1/3 the footprint.** tracedecay is a ~25 MB binary with zero runtime dependencies. CodeGraph is ~80 MB across node_modules and WASM.

**70+ tools vs 9.** CodeGraph covers the basics: search, context, callers, callees, impact, node, files, status, and the newer explore tool. tracedecay adds an entire code quality suite (complexity, coupling, god class detection, inheritance depth, doc coverage, recursion analysis), workflow tools (commit context, PR context, test mapping, diff context), refactoring support (rename preview, similar symbol detection), structural analysis (circular dependencies, unused imports, dead code), and porting tools (port status, port order).

**50+ languages vs 19+.** CodeGraph lists 17 languages by name (TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Go, Rust, Java, C#, PHP, Ruby, C, C++, Swift, Kotlin, Dart, Svelte, Liquid, Pascal/Delphi) with a "19+" designation. tracedecay supports more than 50 — including Svelte and Astro — with deep extractors for Nix, Protobuf, COBOL, Fortran, VB.NET, and legacy BASIC variants that CodeGraph doesn't cover.

**12+ agent integrations vs 1.** CodeGraph supports Claude Code only. tracedecay integrates with Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Cursor, OpenCode, Copilot, Cline, Roo Code, Zed, Antigravity, Kilo, Kiro, Kimi, and Vibe -- each with native configuration format support.

**Optional multi-branch indexing.** tracedecay can optionally maintain per-branch databases with cross-branch diff and search. CodeGraph indexes only the current checkout.

**Annotation extraction.** tracedecay extracts annotations and attributes across 13 languages (Rust, Swift, Dart, Scala, PHP, C++, VB.NET, Java, Kotlin, TypeScript, C#, Python, Zig). CodeGraph doesn't track annotations.

**Per-call token tracking.** tracedecay reports token savings on every MCP tool response plus a live TUI monitor and session/lifetime counters. CodeGraph has no token tracking.

**MCP resources and annotations.** tracedecay exposes 4 MCP resources (status, files, overview, branches) and marks core tools with `readOnlyHint` and `anthropic/alwaysLoad` annotations. CodeGraph has neither.

**Extensive test suite.** tracedecay has 1,000+ tests with 84% line coverage (measured at v3.4.0; more tests have been added since). CodeGraph has minimal test coverage.

**Atomic config writes.** tracedecay creates backups before modifying agent config files and uses atomic staging + rename. A crash during install can't corrupt your settings. CodeGraph writes configs directly.

**Self-update.** `tracedecay upgrade` downloads the correct platform binary from GitHub with stable/beta channel support. CodeGraph relies on `npm update`.

**Where CodeGraph still leads:** CodeGraph's `codegraph_explore` tool (a unified natural-language query tool with call budgets and session deduplication) is a genuinely better interaction pattern for Explore agents. CodeGraph also offers local embedding search via nomic-embed-text-v1.5; tracedecay uses agent-driven keyword expansion via FTS5, which is faster and lighter but doesn't catch conceptual matches with zero lexical overlap.

## vs code-review-graph

code-review-graph is the closest competitor in philosophy -- both build symbol-level graphs with tree-sitter, store them in SQLite, and expose them via MCP tools. The differences are in implementation depth and feature focus.

**Why tracedecay is the better choice:**

**Rust vs Python.** tracedecay is a single native binary with zero runtime dependencies. code-review-graph requires Python 3.10+ and optional dependencies (sentence-transformers, igraph, ollama) that can total hundreds of megabytes.

**Deeper code quality analysis.** tracedecay has 9 quality/structure tools: `complexity`, `coupling`, `god_class`, `inheritance_depth`, `doc_coverage`, `recursion`, `unused_imports`, `dead_code`, and `simplify_scan`. code-review-graph has `find_large_functions_tool` -- one tool that checks function length.

**Type system awareness.** `type_hierarchy` and `inheritance_depth` provide recursive trait/interface/class inheritance trees. code-review-graph doesn't track type relationships.

**Richer git integration.** tracedecay offers `commit_context`, `pr_context`, `diff_context`, `changelog`, and `test_map` for workflow automation. code-review-graph has `detect_changes_tool` with risk scoring, but no commit/PR context generation or test mapping.

**Optional multi-branch indexing.** tracedecay can optionally maintain per-branch databases with cross-branch diff and search via `branch_search`, `branch_diff`, and `branch_list`. code-review-graph has no branch awareness.

**More languages with deeper extraction.** 50+ languages with deep extractors (Nix derivation fields, Protobuf message/service/rpc, COBOL, Fortran, legacy BASIC) vs 19 languages with standard tree-sitter extraction.

**No long-lived watcher process.** tracedecay refreshes its index on demand — a staleness check on each MCP call plus a catch-up sync when the server connects — so there is no separate process to manage. code-review-graph has a foreground `watch` command that stops when you close the terminal.

**Porting tools.** `port_status` and `port_order` help assess and plan cross-language porting with topological dependency ordering. code-review-graph has no equivalent.

**Per-call token tracking.** Every tool response includes `tracedecay_metrics: before=N after=M`. Plus a live TUI monitor, session counters, and a worldwide aggregate counter. code-review-graph has no token tracking.

**MCP resources and annotations.** 4 MCP resources and `readOnlyHint`/`alwaysLoad` annotations on core tools. code-review-graph has neither.

**Faster indexing.** ~1.2s for 1,782 files (full index) vs ~2s for 2,900 files (incremental, not directly comparable but indicative of similar performance class with tracedecay handling more extraction depth).

**Extensive test suite.** 1,000+ tests with 84% line coverage (measured at v3.4.0; more tests added since) vs unpublished coverage.

**Where code-review-graph still leads:** Multi-repository registry with cross-repo search, execution flow analysis with criticality ranking, community detection via the Leiden algorithm, wiki generation from the code graph, 5 MCP prompt templates for common workflows, apply-refactoring (not just preview), notebook support (Jupyter/Databricks), published accuracy benchmarks (F1/precision/recall across 6 repos), and support for Windsurf, Continue, and Antigravity (which tracedecay lacks, while tracedecay supports Gemini CLI, Copilot, Cline, and Roo Code which code-review-graph lacks).

## vs OpenWolf

OpenWolf takes a fundamentally different approach. It doesn't build a code graph at all -- it wraps Claude Code's lifecycle with six hook scripts that monitor file reads/writes, block redundant reads, and carry forward corrections across sessions.

**Why tracedecay is the better choice:**

**Code intelligence vs behavioral guardrails.** tracedecay understands your code: it knows every function, every call edge, every type hierarchy, every dependency chain. OpenWolf knows files exist and how big they are, but has zero understanding of what's inside them. It can't answer "who calls this function?", "what breaks if I change this?", or "show me the type hierarchy."

**70+ MCP tools vs zero.** OpenWolf is entirely hook-based -- it has no MCP tools at all. The AI can't query it. It can only intercept and annotate the AI's existing tool calls. tracedecay gives the AI more than 70 structured tools to actively explore the codebase.

**50+ languages with deep extraction.** tracedecay parses more than 50 languages at the symbol level. OpenWolf is language-agnostic because it only tracks files, not code structure.

**12+ agent integrations vs 1.** OpenWolf works only with Claude Code. tracedecay works with more than a dozen AI coding agents.

**Zero runtime dependencies.** tracedecay is a single Rust binary. OpenWolf requires Node.js 20+, optional PM2, and optional puppeteer-core.

**MIT vs AGPL-3.0.** tracedecay's MIT license imposes no restrictions. OpenWolf's AGPL-3.0 requires derivative works to be open-sourced -- a concern for commercial tooling built on top of it.

**Where OpenWolf still leads:** Redundant-read blocking (~71% of repeated reads prevented), correction memory across sessions (`cerebrum.md`), searchable bug history (`buglog.json`), file-size awareness before reads, and design QC with automatic dev server screenshot capture. These features address a different class of waste (behavioral inefficiency) that tracedecay doesn't touch. The two tools are complementary and can run side by side.

## Cross-cutting advantages

Several of tracedecay's advantages apply across all four comparisons:

**Single native binary, zero dependencies.** Every alternative requires a runtime: Python, Node.js, or both. tracedecay installs and runs with nothing else on the machine.

**Broadest language support.** More than 50 languages with three compilation tiers (lite/medium/full) for binary size control. No other tool in this space covers as many languages with as much extraction depth.

**Broadest agent support.** More than a dozen AI coding agent integrations with per-agent native configuration formats. code-review-graph supports 8 platforms with partial overlap (it adds Windsurf, Continue; tracedecay adds Gemini CLI, Copilot, Cline, Roo Code). No other tool covers as many agents with as deep an integration (hooks, prompt rules, tool permissions).

**Optional multi-branch indexing.** The only tool with optional per-branch graph databases and cross-branch diff and search.

**Per-call token tracking.** The only tool that reports exactly how many tokens each individual MCP tool call saved, plus a live TUI monitor across all projects.

**Fully open source.** MIT-licensed Rust, auditable end to end. Dual-Graph's core is proprietary. OpenWolf is AGPL-3.0. CodeGraph and code-review-graph are MIT but implemented in Node.js and Python respectively, with heavier dependency trees that are harder to audit in practice.

**Atomic, safe configuration.** tracedecay is the only tool that creates backups before modifying agent config files and uses atomic writes. A crash or interruption during install can't corrupt your settings.
