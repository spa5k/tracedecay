## Zero-Coverage Files

These files have 0% line coverage and are not exercised by any test:

| File | Lines | Reason |
|------|------:|--------|
| main.rs | 721 | Binary entrypoint — CLI dispatch, not reachable from `cargo test` |
| doctor.rs | 156 | System health checks — calls external binaries, inspects filesystem state |

## Regenerating This Report

```sh
cargo install cargo-llvm-cov
rustup component add llvm-tools-preview
cargo llvm-cov --tests --features test-transport --json > coverage.json
```

Note: `--features test-transport` is required to include the MCP server end-to-end tests
(`tests/mcp_server_test.rs`) which use the `ChannelTransport` in-memory transport.
