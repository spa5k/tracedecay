## Why tokensave?

AI coding agents waste tokens exploring codebases. Every grep, glob, and file read costs money. On complex tasks, agents spawn multiple Explore sub-agents that scan hundreds of files just to build context.

**tokensave gives agents a pre-indexed semantic knowledge graph.** Instead of scanning files, the agent queries the graph and gets instant, structured answers -- the right symbols, their relationships, and source code, in one call.

### How It Works

```

**Without tokensave:** Agents use `grep`, `glob`, and `Read` to scan files -- many API calls, high token usage.

**With tokensave:** Agents query the graph via MCP tools -- instant results, local processing, fewer tokens.

## Key Features

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| **Smart Context Building** | **Semantic Search** | **Impact Analysis** |
| One tool call returns everything the agent needs -- entry points, related symbols, and code snippets. | Find code by meaning, not just text. Search for "authentication" and find `login`, `validateToken`, `AuthService`. | Know exactly what breaks before you change it. Trace callers, callees, and the full impact radius of any symbol. |
| **70+ MCP Tools** | **50+ Languages** | **12+ Agent Integrations** |
| From call graph traversal to dead code detection, atomic edit primitives, code-health metrics, test mapping, and complexity analysis. | Rust, Go, Java, Python, TypeScript, C, C++, Swift, Svelte, Astro, and 42 more including WGSL/HLSL/Metal shaders and Markdown. Three tiers (lite/medium/full) control binary size. | Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Hermes, Kiro, Cursor, OpenCode, Copilot, Cline, Roo Code, Zed, Antigravity, Kilo CLI, Kimi CLI, Mistral Vibe. |
| **Multi-Branch Indexing (opt-in)** | **100% Local** | **Always Fresh** |
| Optional per-branch databases. Cross-branch diff and search without switching your checkout. | Source code and memory content stay on your machine. No API keys or hosted database are required; the index runs on local libSQL. | On-demand staleness check on every MCP call (30 s cooldown) plus catch-up sync when the server connects. Multi-agent work is expected to use git worktrees — each agent gets its own checkout and the index diverges are merged by git, not by a file watcher. |
| **Subprocess-Isolated Extraction** | **Code-Health Analytics** | **Atomic Edit Primitives** |
| A native crash in any tree-sitter grammar (abort, segfault, anything) kills only the worker; the pool respawns it and sync continues. Sync never dies on a malformed file. | Composite health score (0-10000), Gini inequality, file-DAG depth, design-structure matrix, risk-weighted test gaps, and session deltas. | Edit files without regex or shell-quoting hazards: unique-anchor `str_replace`, atomic multi-replace, AST-rewrite, anchored insert. Auto re-indexes after writes. |

```bash
tokensave install                         # auto-detects installed agents
tokensave install --agent antigravity     # Google Antigravity (formerly Windsurf)
tokensave install --agent claude          # Claude Code
tokensave install --agent cline           # Cline
tokensave install --agent codex           # OpenAI Codex CLI
tokensave install --agent copilot         # GitHub Copilot
tokensave install --agent cursor          # Cursor
tokensave install --agent gemini          # Gemini CLI
tokensave install --agent hermes          # Hermes Agent
tokensave install --agent hermes --profile work
tokensave install --agent kilo            # Kilo CLI
tokensave install --agent kiro            # AWS Kiro
tokensave install --agent kimi            # Moonshot Kimi CLI
tokensave install --agent opencode        # OpenCode
tokensave install --agent roo-code        # Roo Code
tokensave install --agent vibe            # Mistral Vibe
tokensave install --agent zed             # Zed
```

Each agent gets its MCP server registered in the native config format where that is the agent's integration model. Claude Code additionally gets a PreToolUse hook (blocks wasteful Explore agents), a UserPromptSubmit hook, a Stop hook, prompt rules in CLAUDE.md, and auto-allowed tool permissions. Kiro gets global MCP config, `tokensave.md` steering loaded as a resource, and a tokensave-managed default agent with permissive built-in/tokensave tool approval, delegation guardrail hooks, and post-write sync; user-managed Kiro agents are preserved. Codex gets MCP config + auto-approval in `~/.codex/config.toml`, prompt rules in `AGENTS.md`, and a Claude-style lifecycle hook set in `~/.codex/hooks.json` (see below). Hermes gets a native profile plugin that registers tokensave tools through Hermes' plugin API. Cursor global install currently registers the MCP server only; the richer Cursor integration is project-local so it can be checked into a repository.

All changes are idempotent -- safe to run again after upgrading. After agent setup, you'll be offered a global git post-commit hook.

For project-scoped setup, run from the repository root:

```bash
tokensave install --local --agent cursor
```

Local install writes only workspace files such as `.cursor/mcp.json`, `.mcp.json`, `.codex/config.toml`, `.vscode/mcp.json`, `.hermes/plugins/tokensave/`, or the equivalent project config for Claude, Codex, Gemini, Hermes, Kiro, OpenCode, Copilot/VS Code, Zed, Roo Code, Kimi, Kilo, and Vibe. Generated MCP configs and plugin wrappers use the resolved absolute `tokensave` executable path. Hermes installs into `~/.hermes/plugins/tokensave/` by default, or into `~/.hermes/profiles/<name>/plugins/tokensave/` with `--profile <name>`; profile names are normalized to lowercase and must match `[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]{0,63}`. Use `tokensave uninstall --agent hermes --profile <name>` to remove a named profile install; `reinstall` and `doctor --agent hermes` currently operate on the default profile. Hermes wrappers run from Hermes' current working directory, use a 600-second timeout, and include truncated stdout/stderr in error JSON. Hermes local install without `--profile` writes only project plugin files and `.hermes/config.yaml`; `tokensave install --local --agent hermes --profile <name>` is a deliberate mixed-scope mode that targets the named profile instead. Hermes requires `HERMES_ENABLE_PROJECT_PLUGINS=true` when launching with project-local plugins. For Cursor, local install also writes `.cursor/rules/tokensave.mdc`, `.cursor/permissions.json`, and `.cursor/hooks.json`: the rule tells Cursor Agent to prefer tokensave MCP tools for codebase exploration, and permissions auto-allow the local tokensave MCP surface for that workspace. The project hooks are:

- `sessionStart` — fire-and-forget; injects context steering the Agent toward tokensave MCP tools and reports index freshness (suggests `tokensave init` when no `.tokensave/` exists).
- `subagentStart` — blocks research/explore subagents until tokensave MCP tools have been tried.
- `beforeSubmitPrompt` — resets the local token counter for the new turn and ingests the current Cursor transcript into `.tokensave/sessions.db` when `transcript_path` is present.
- `afterFileEdit` (matcher `Write`) — runs a **targeted single-file** sync of just the edited path(s) via `sync_if_stale_silent`, never a full-tree scan (which would scale with repo size, not edit size).
- `afterShellExecution` — on Agent-run `git checkout`/`switch`/`worktree add`, bootstraps/maintains tokensave branch tracking (`branch add`); on other state-changing git commands (pull/merge/rebase/reset/cherry-pick/stash apply|pop), runs a coalesced incremental sync.
- `workspaceOpen` — ensures the current branch's DB exists (branch add if missing) and runs a catch-up incremental sync.

All Cursor hooks are fail-open and only act when a `.tokensave/` index already exists. **Blind spot:** Cursor hooks only observe the Cursor Agent's own actions and IDE lifecycle. Manual/external-terminal `git checkout` and in-place branch switches are NOT seen by these hooks (`workspaceOpen` does not fire for an in-place checkout). For those, the git post-commit hook and the on-demand MCP staleness check remain the freshness mechanism. We intentionally do not add `beforeReadFile`/`preToolUse` blocking hooks here (too aggressive/noisy); they may become opt-in later.

### Codex lifecycle hooks

Codex now supports a Claude-style lifecycle hook system (verified against Codex 0.136.0 — the old "Codex has no hook system" note was wrong). Both global (`~/.codex/hooks.json`) and project-local (`<root>/.codex/hooks.json`) installs register tokensave hooks, written in Codex's nested `hooks[event] -> { matcher?, hooks: [ { type:"command", command, timeout } ] }` shape and reconciled idempotently (foreign hooks preserved). Each hook reads Codex's stdin JSON event and emits Codex-shaped stdout:

- `SessionStart` — emits `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` steering the agent toward tokensave MCP tools and reporting index freshness (suggests `tokensave init` when uninitialized).
- `UserPromptSubmit` — resets the per-project local counter and injects the same steering context for the new turn.
- `SubagentStart` — redirects research/explore subagents toward tokensave MCP tools via `additionalContext`. (Per Codex docs, `SubagentStart` cannot hard-stop a subagent — `continue:false` is ignored — so this steers rather than denies.)
- `PostToolUse` (matcher `Bash|apply_patch`) — for `apply_patch` edits, runs a **targeted single-file** sync of just the patched paths (parsed from the patch envelope); for `Bash` git commands, reuses the shared classifier to route branch switches → `branch add` and other state-changing commands → coalesced incremental sync.

All Codex hooks are fail-open and only act when a `.tokensave/` index exists. **Trust gate:** Codex skips new or changed non-managed command hooks until you trust them — run `/hooks` inside Codex to review and trust the tokensave hooks (the installer prints this reminder; `--dangerously-bypass-hook-trust` exists for one-off non-interactive runs). **Blind spots:** `PostToolUse` only fires for `apply_patch` edits and "simple" Bash — raw-shell file edits, `unified_exec`, and `WebSearch` are not observed; there is no first-class branch-switch event, so branch switches are derived from Bash `git` commands. `PreToolUse` is intentionally not installed: Codex documents it as a partial guardrail (it can't intercept `unified_exec`/`WebSearch`/raw-shell edits), so a redundant-exploration blocker there would be unreliable and noisy.

Local install does not update `~/.tokensave/config.toml`, installed-agent tracking, the last installed version, or the global git post-commit hook. Antigravity and Cline are global-only and return clear unsupported errors for `--local`.

### 3. Index your project

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
tokensave init
```

This creates a `.tokensave/` directory with the knowledge graph database. Initialization and sync are separate commands: `init` is a one-time opt-in per project, while `sync` only updates projects that were already initialized. This prevents the global git post-commit hook from silently creating databases in repos you never intended to index. After `init`, use `tokensave sync` to incrementally update -- only changed files are re-indexed.

<summary><strong>What install writes for Claude Code</strong></summary>

#### MCP server

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tokensave": {
      "command": "/path/to/tokensave",
      "args": ["serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### PreToolUse hook

The hook runs `tokensave hook-pre-tool-use` -- a native Rust command (no bash or jq required). It intercepts Agent tool calls and blocks Explore agents, redirecting Claude to use tokensave MCP tools instead.

#### CLAUDE.md rules

Appends instructions to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` that tell Claude to use tokensave tools before reaching for Explore agents or raw file reads.

## Crash-Resilient Sync

Tree-sitter grammars are compiled C/C++ code. They occasionally hit an internal assertion or otherwise terminate the process by paths that Rust panic handling cannot intercept. As of v4.3.0, every file is parsed inside a short-lived worker subprocess: if a grammar segfaults, calls `abort()`, or hits a stack overflow, only the worker dies. The pool respawns it, the offending file is logged and skipped, and `sync` keeps going.

The worker is a hidden `extract-worker` subcommand authenticated against the parent via a 256-bit per-spawn token, required as both a `TOKENSAVE_WORKER_TOKEN` env var and as the first 32 bytes received on stdin. Direct invocation by users fails. Defaults to `available_parallelism()` workers; opt out with `TOKENSAVE_DISABLE_SUBPROCESS=1`.

Edit primitives (`tokensave_str_replace`, `tokensave_insert_at`, etc.) still run in-process: they target one file at a time where subprocess overhead would dominate, and an extractor crash there is immediately visible to the agent.

---

## Multi-Branch Indexing (Optional)

tokensave can optionally maintain a separate code graph per git branch. When enabled, switching branches never gives you stale results and never re-indexes files you already parsed on another branch. Multi-branch tracking is opt-in -- without it, tokensave uses a single database for all branches.

### How it works

When you track a branch, tokensave copies the nearest ancestor DB and syncs only the files that differ. This means tracking a feature branch off `main` is nearly instant -- it only parses the files you've changed.

### CLI commands

```bash
tokensave branch add              # track the current branch
tokensave branch list             # see tracked branches and DB sizes
tokensave branch remove <name>    # stop tracking a branch
tokensave branch removeall        # remove all tracked branches except default
tokensave branch gc               # clean up branches deleted from git
```

### Cross-branch MCP tools

Three MCP tools enable cross-branch queries without switching your checkout:

- **`tokensave_branch_search`** -- search symbols in another branch's graph
- **`tokensave_branch_diff`** -- compare code graphs between two branches: symbols added, removed, and changed (signature differs). Supports file and kind filters.
- **`tokensave_branch_list`** -- list tracked branches with DB sizes, parent branch, and sync times

### Branch fallback

When the MCP server can't find a database for the current branch, it serves from the nearest ancestor branch's DB and includes a warning in every tool response suggesting you run `tokensave branch add`.

See [docs/BRANCHING-USER-GUIDE.md](docs/BRANCHING-USER-GUIDE.md) for the full guide.

---

## Cross-Session Memory

tokensave memory is stored in the per-project `.tokensave/tokensave.db` as durable, entity-linked facts:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `tokensave_fact_store` | Store a fact with entities, source, reason, related facts, contradictions, tags, and an initial confidence signal |
| `tokensave_fact_feedback` | Record user or agent feedback that raises, lowers, supersedes, or contradicts a fact's trust score |
| `tokensave_memory_status` | Repair dirty memory banks, then inspect fact-store readiness, entity counts, trust-score distribution, and vector/backfill health |

Trust scoring is fact-level, not just text-level. The store combines source metadata, feedback history, retrieval counters, contradiction scans, and recency into the returned score components. Entity recall returns facts linked to the requested symbol, file, subsystem, or named concept with `why` metadata so agents can explain why a memory was surfaced.

See [docs/USER-GUIDE.md](docs/USER-GUIDE.md#memory-and-fact-recall) for common memory payloads. For the exact current input schema, inspect the live MCP descriptors for `tokensave_fact_store`, `tokensave_fact_feedback`, and `tokensave_memory_status`.

---

## Savings Ledger

Every MCP call writes an append-only row to `~/.tokensave/global.db` (`savings_ledger` table). Inspect with `tokensave gain`:

```bash
tokensave gain                    # current project, last 30 days
tokensave gain --all              # all projects
tokensave gain --history --range 7d
tokensave gain --json
```

Dollar estimates use the existing pricing module (Sonnet input pricing, refreshed daily via LiteLLM).

---

## Reproducible Benchmark

`tokensave bench` runs a fixed query set through `tokensave_context` and reports retrieval savings vs a full-file baseline (mirrors the CCE methodology):

```bash
tokensave bench                                    # ships with 10 default queries
tokensave bench --queries my-queries.toml --json
tokensave bench --max-nodes 5
```

**Measured against this repo (`tokensave` itself) using the shipped generic query set:**

| # | Query | Baseline | Context | Savings |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | How is configuration loaded at startup? | 15,475 | 460 | 97% |
| 2 | Where are command-line arguments parsed and dispatched? | 8,047 | 242 | 97% |
| 3 | How is the main entry point organized? | 11,883 | 242 | 98% |
| 4 | How are errors defined, wrapped, and propagated? | 11,883 | 270 | 98% |
| 5 | Where is logging or diagnostic output emitted? | 14,714 | 310 | 98% |
| 6 | How are tests organized and what test harness is used? | 348 | 195 | 44% |
| 7 | How is data persisted to disk or to a database? | 53,894 | 414 | 99% |
| 8 | How are async tasks or background work spawned? | 13,439 | 221 | 98% |
| 9 | How does the build wire up dependencies and initialize state? | 20,368 | 400 | 98% |
| 10 | How are public API surfaces exposed (HTTP endpoints, library exports, or CLI commands)? | 30,345 | 630 | 98% |

**Aggregate:** 93% mean retrieval savings (180,396 → 3,384 tokens across 10 queries).

The default query set targets patterns present in most application codebases (CLIs, daemons, services). Run it on your own project with `tokensave bench` to see your numbers, or write a tailored query file (`--queries my.toml`) for tighter recall.

### Criterion bench against large real-world repos

`benches/large_repos.rs` is a [criterion](https://bheisler.github.io/criterion.rs/book/) micro-benchmark that exercises the MCP tools end-to-end against four large open-source codebases pinned at constant refs. Each tool is driven by **at least 5 queries** with arguments (node ids, qualified names, file globs, …) sampled from the indexed graph once per repo, so timings are reproducible across runs.

**Repos and pinned refs** (defined in `benches/repos.rs`):

| Repo | URL | Ref |
|---|---|---|
| polkadot-sdk | https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk | `polkadot-stable2412` |
| emacs | https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs | `emacs-30.1` |
| scipy | https://github.com/scipy/scipy | `v1.14.1` |
| node | https://github.com/nodejs/node | `v22.11.0` |

Each repo is shallow-cloned (`git init` + `git fetch --progress --depth 1 origin <ref>` + `checkout FETCH_HEAD`) on first use and cached locally; subsequent runs reuse the checkout. Git output is streamed to the terminal so the multi-GB fetch shows real-time progress.

**Tools covered (5 queries each).** Read tools — `search`, `context`, `callers`, `callees`, `node`, `by_qualified_name`, `signature`, `impact`, `body`, `files`, `complexity`, `doc_coverage`, `largest`, `hotspots`, `god_class`, `module_api`, `derives`, `dead_code`, `rank`, `coupling`, `circular`. Write tools — `str_replace`, `multi_str_replace`, `insert_at`, and (if `ast-grep` is on `PATH`) `ast_grep_rewrite`.

**Force-sync on every run.** Before any benchmark fires, the harness runs the equivalent of `tokensave sync --force` on each repo (`index_all()` regardless of `.tokensave/` freshness) so timings always reflect the pinned source.

**Write benches and cleanup.** Write tools mutate files. To keep the "match must be unique" precondition holding, the harness uses criterion's `iter_batched` — a small scratch file under `<repo>/.tokensave-bench-scratch/` is rewritten with known content **before every timed iteration**, then the edit tool runs against it. After all benchmarks finish, the harness runs `git stash --include-untracked && git stash drop` inside every prepared repo so the working tree returns to the pinned ref.

**Criterion configuration.** The bench overrides criterion's defaults to `sample_size = 10` and `measurement_time = 30s` (vs the stock 100 / 5s), which gives each per-query timing ~30 seconds of measurement — enough that slow tools like `tokensave_context` on polkadot-sdk produce stable numbers.

**Run it:**

```bash
# Required: a writable cache directory for the cloned repos + their indexes.
# Expect several GB of disk and a long first run (shallow clone + full index of each repo).
export TOKENSAVE_BENCH_REPOS_DIR=~/tokensave-bench-cache

cargo bench --bench large_repos
```

If `TOKENSAVE_BENCH_REPOS_DIR` is unset the bench prints a notice and registers zero benchmarks (so `cargo bench --all` stays cheap on contributors' machines).

**Configuration (all optional, via environment):**

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `TOKENSAVE_BENCH_REPOS_DIR` | **Required.** Root directory where each repo is cloned to `$DIR/<repo-name>/`. |
| `TOKENSAVE_BENCH_REPOS` | Comma-separated subset of repo names to bench, e.g. `TOKENSAVE_BENCH_REPOS=emacs,scipy`. Defaults to all four. |
| `TOKENSAVE_BENCH_SKIP_CLONE` | If set, the bench fails fast for any repo not already at its pinned ref instead of fetching. Useful in CI / offline runs. |

**Filtering benchmarks** uses the standard criterion CLI — for example, only the `search` tool on `scipy`:

```bash
cargo bench --bench large_repos -- 'scipy/tokensave_search'
```

Reports (HTML + raw samples) land under `target/criterion/`.

To change the pinned refs (e.g. to a newer release or a specific SHA), edit `REPOS` in `benches/repos.rs` and delete the corresponding `$TOKENSAVE_BENCH_REPOS_DIR/<repo>/.bench-ref` marker so the next run re-fetches. If you skip the post-run cleanup (e.g. you `Ctrl-C` mid-bench), running `git stash --include-untracked && git stash drop` inside each repo dir restores it manually.

### MCP test-matrix probe (scripts/mcp_probe)

`scripts/mcp_probe/` is a Python harness that drives `tokensave serve` over stdio against a configurable set of real repos and exercises **every read-only MCP tool with 5 query variants per language**, producing a per-tool / per-repo status table. Same harness serves two purposes:

- **Regression sweep.** New language support, new tool, or a refactor — re-run the matrix and any cell that newly errors, times out, or returns empty results stands out as a 🚩.
- **Perf probe.** Per-call timings are logged in TSV; the same fixed corpus of repos doubles as a coarse cross-version comparison. The current `tokensave_inheritance_depth` cycle bug was found by this harness when a single tool on polkadot-sdk timed out at >60 s.

**Layout** — `probe.py` is the driver (id-matched JSON-RPC so a slow tool can't poison subsequent calls), `isolated.py` re-runs a single tool with a fresh server per call (escapes server queueing), `build_matrix.py` reads the TSV and emits markdown, `tools/<lang>.py` modules contribute per-language query sets (Rust shipped; add Python/Go/… by dropping a new module), `repos.toml` lists target repos (override via `$TOKENSAVE_PROBE_REPOS`).

**Quick run:**

```bash
cargo build --release --bin tokensave
python3 scripts/mcp_probe/probe.py
python3 scripts/mcp_probe/build_matrix.py > matrix.md
```

Output cells are `✓ 5/5` (clean), `🐛 e/N` (errors), `⏱ N/N` (timeouts), `∅ E/N` (empty), `🐢 ok/slow` (>10 s calls). Any cell carrying an error or timeout earns a 🚩 in the rightmost column. Per-call detail with the first 100 chars of each error landS in the TSV log for follow-up.

Different from the criterion bench above: criterion measures per-iteration latency for a focused tool set on pinned refs and produces statistical reports under `target/criterion/`; `mcp_probe` exercises every tool with a broader query set on whatever repos you point it at, optimising for breadth of coverage rather than measurement precision.

## 70+ MCP Tools

The server exposes more than 70 tools (one fewer when the optional `ast-grep` binary is not on `PATH`); the tables below group the most commonly used ones by category. Most are read-only, safe to call in parallel, and annotated with `readOnlyHint`. The edit primitives are scoped to single files and re-index in place; session baseline and memory tools also mutate local `.tokensave` state and are annotated as non-read-only. The three core tools (`tokensave_context`, `tokensave_search`, `tokensave_status`) are marked `anthropic/alwaysLoad` so they bypass the client's tool-search round-trip.

### Discovery

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `tokensave_context` | Get relevant code context for a task -- entry points, related symbols, code snippets |
| `tokensave_search` | Find symbols by name (functions, classes, types) |
| `tokensave_node` | Get details + source code for a specific symbol |
| `tokensave_files` | List indexed project files with filtering |
| `tokensave_module_api` | Public API surface of a file or directory |
| `tokensave_similar` | Find symbols with similar names |
| `tokensave_status` | Index status, statistics, tokens saved |

### Call Graph & Impact

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `tokensave_callers` | Find what calls a function |
| `tokensave_callees` | Find what a function calls |
| `tokensave_impact` | See what's affected by changing a symbol |
| `tokensave_affected` | Find test files affected by source changes |
| `tokensave_rename_preview` | All references to a symbol (preview rename impact) |
| `tokensave_hotspots` | Most connected symbols (highest call count) |

### Code Quality

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `tokensave_complexity` | Rank functions by cyclomatic complexity, nesting depth, safety metrics |
| `tokensave_dead_code` | Find unreachable symbols (no incoming edges) |
| `tokensave_god_class` | Find classes with too many members |
| `tokensave_coupling` | Rank files by fan-in/fan-out |
| `tokensave_inheritance_depth` | Find the deepest inheritance hierarchies |
| `tokensave_circular` | Detect circular file dependencies |
| `tokensave_recursion` | Detect recursive/mutually-recursive call cycles |
| `tokensave_unused_imports` | Import statements never referenced |
| `tokensave_doc_coverage` | Public symbols missing documentation |
| `tokensave_simplify_scan` | Quality analysis of changed files (duplications, dead code, complexity) |

### Code-Health Analytics

Five tools surface structural quality signals from the existing graph. The composite score uses a geometric mean over independent dimensions so no single one can be gamed.

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `tokensave_health` | Composite quality signal (0-10000) from acyclicity, depth, equality, redundancy, and modularity |
| `tokensave_gini` | Gini inequality coefficient for any metric (complexity, lines, fan-in/out, members) -- finds god files and uneven distribution |
| `tokensave_dependency_depth` | Longest file-level dependency chains (Lakos levelization) with full chain reconstruction after Tarjan SCC cycle-breaking |
| `tokensave_dsm` | Design Structure Matrix in `stats`, `clusters`, or `matrix` form -- reveals layering violations and hidden coupling |
| `tokensave_test_risk` | Risk-weighted test-gap analysis combining complexity, fan-in, coverage, and 90-day git churn into a single score |

### Sessions

Snapshot health metrics at the start of an AI coding session, then diff at the end to see what improved or regressed.

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `tokensave_session_start` | Save current health metrics as a JSON baseline for later comparison |
| `tokensave_session_end` | Recompute and diff against the baseline -- per-dimension deltas, pass/fail, automatic cleanup |

### Edit Primitives

Four writer tools that let agents modify files without regex or shell-quoting hazards. Each is single-file, anchored, and triggers an in-place re-index after writing so the graph never goes stale.

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `tokensave_str_replace` | Replace a unique `old_str` with `new_str`; fails if 0 or >1 matches (protects against multi-edit bugs) |
| `tokensave_multi_str_replace` | Apply N `(old, new)` replacements atomically -- all-or-nothing transaction |
| `tokensave_insert_at` | Insert content before or after a unique anchor string or line number |
| `tokensave_ast_grep_rewrite` | Structural code rewrite via the `ast-grep` CLI in `--rewrite` mode |

### Git & Workflow

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `tokensave_diff_context` | Semantic context for changed files -- modified symbols, dependencies, affected tests |
| `tokensave_commit_context` | Semantic summary of uncommitted changes for commit message drafting |
| `tokensave_pr_context` | Semantic diff between git refs for pull request descriptions |
| `tokensave_changelog` | Semantic diff between two git refs |

| `tokensave_rank` | Rank nodes by relationship count (most implemented interface, most extended class) |
| `tokensave_distribution` | Node kind breakdown per file or directory |
| `tokensave_largest` | Rank nodes by size -- largest classes, longest methods |

### Porting

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `tokensave_port_status` | Compare symbols between source/target directories to track porting progress |
| `tokensave_port_order` | Topological sort of symbols for porting -- port leaves first, then dependents |

### Multi-Branch

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `tokensave_branch_search` | Search symbols in another branch's graph |
| `tokensave_branch_diff` | Compare symbols between branches (added/removed/changed) |
| `tokensave_branch_list` | List tracked branches with DB sizes and sync times |

### MCP Resources

Four resources are exposed via `resources/list` and `resources/read`:

- `tokensave://status` -- graph statistics as JSON
- `tokensave://files` -- indexed file tree grouped by directory
- `tokensave://overview` -- project summary with language distribution and symbol kinds
- `tokensave://branches` -- tracked branches with DB sizes and parent info

---

## Token Tracking

tokensave measures the tokens it saves on every MCP tool call. Each tool response includes a `tokensave_metrics: before=N after=M` line showing how many raw-file tokens were avoided by that specific call.

### Cost observability

```bash
tokensave cost                     # 7-day cost summary (default)
tokensave cost today               # today only
tokensave cost --by-model          # breakdown by Claude model
tokensave cost --by-task           # breakdown by task category (coding, debugging, exploration, ...)
tokensave cost --export json       # JSON export to stdout
tokensave cost --export csv        # CSV export to stdout
```

Parses Claude Code session transcripts (`~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl`), classifies each API turn into one of 13 task categories, computes dollar cost using model pricing, and stores results in `~/.tokensave/global.db` for fast aggregate queries. Pricing is refreshed from [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm) every 24 hours and falls back to an embedded table when offline.

The `tokensave status` header includes a cost row showing today's spend, 7-day total, and efficiency ratio (tokens saved / total tokens). The `tokensave monitor` TUI shows a live cost panel alongside the savings feed. At the end of each Claude Code session, the `hook_stop` handler prints a one-line receipt to the terminal.

Task classification categories: Coding, Debugging, Feature Dev, Refactoring, Testing, Exploration, Planning, Delegation, Git Ops, Build/Deploy, Brainstorming, Conversation, General. Classification is deterministic (pattern matching on tool names and Bash commands), requires no LLM calls, and is adapted from [AgentSeal/codeburn](https://github.com/AgentSeal/codeburn).

### Live monitor

```bash
tokensave monitor
```

A global TUI that shows MCP tool calls from all projects in real time, via a shared memory-mapped ring buffer at `~/.tokensave/monitor.mmap`. Each entry shows the project name, tool name, and token delta. A cost panel at the top shows today's spend, savings, efficiency, and top model (refreshed every 30 seconds).

### Session and lifetime counters

```bash
tokensave current-counter          # show per-project session counter
tokensave reset-counter            # reset the session counter
tokensave status                   # shows project + global lifetime totals + cost
```

### Worldwide counter

All tokensave users contribute to an anonymous aggregate counter. `tokensave status` shows both your project total and the worldwide total. The upload sends only a single number (e.g. `4823`) with no identifying information. Opt out with `tokensave disable-upload-counter`.

---

## Index Freshness

tokensave keeps the graph up to date without a background daemon or an OS-level file watcher.

**On-demand staleness check.** Every MCP tool call checks whether any indexed files have been modified since the last sync. If stale files are found, they are re-extracted before the tool response is returned. A 30-second cooldown prevents back-to-back calls from re-walking the tree on every keystroke.

**Catch-up sync on connect.** When the MCP server starts, it immediately runs a non-blocking catch-up sync that picks up any changes made while no agent was attached — a `git pull`, an IDE edit, a build step — so the very first tool call of a session sees a fresh index.

**Multi-agent work and git worktrees.** When multiple agents work on the same project concurrently, the strong assumption is that each agent operates in its own git worktree. Worktrees are independent filesystem checkouts of the same repository: agent A and agent B each have their own copy of every file, so they never overwrite each other's in-flight edits. tokensave automatically detects when a query comes from a worktree nested inside the main checkout and serves results from the correct branch graph. Changes accumulate independently and are eventually reconciled via git merge or rebase — the same process used for any other parallel development. This design avoids the complexity and failure modes of cross-agent locking over a shared mutable directory.

**CLI-only workflows.** If you run `tokensave` commands without an attached agent (no MCP server), the staleness check is not running between commands. Install a git post-commit hook to keep the index fresh automatically after every commit:

```bash
cp scripts/post-commit .git/hooks/post-commit
chmod +x .git/hooks/post-commit
```

### Upgrading from 5.x

The standalone `tokensave daemon` command and its launchd/systemd/Windows Service autostart were removed in 6.0.0. The embedded OS-level file watcher that replaced the daemon was itself removed in 6.1.0 (it caused runaway CPU and memory on large monorepos with deep `node_modules` or `target` trees). The on-demand staleness model above is the current design.

If you still have a daemon autostart from 5.x, remove it:

- macOS: `launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.tokensave.daemon.plist && rm ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.tokensave.daemon.plist`
- Linux: `systemctl --user disable --now tokensave-daemon && rm ~/.config/systemd/user/tokensave-daemon.service`
- Windows: `sc.exe delete tokensave-daemon` (from an elevated terminal)

If you don't recall the exact name: `launchctl list | grep tokensave` / `systemctl --user list-units | grep tokensave` / `sc.exe query state= all | findstr -i tokensave`.

---

## Self-Upgrade

```bash
tokensave upgrade                  # upgrade to latest in current channel
tokensave channel                  # show current channel (stable/beta)
tokensave channel beta             # switch to beta channel
tokensave channel stable           # switch back to stable
```

`tokensave upgrade` downloads the correct platform binary from GitHub releases and replaces the running binary in place. Supports stable and beta channels independently.

---

```

---

## `tokensave doctor`

Run a comprehensive health check of your tokensave installation:

```bash
tokensave doctor
```

Checks: binary location, project index, global DB, user config, agent integration (MCP server, hooks, permissions, prompt rules), and network connectivity. If any tool permissions are missing after an upgrade, it tells you to run `tokensave install`. Use `--agent` to check a specific agent only.

Doctor also validates that each installed hook uses the correct tokensave subcommand and auto-repairs broken hooks.

---

## How It Works with Claude Code

Once configured, Claude Code automatically uses tokensave instead of reading raw files when it needs to understand your codebase. Three layers reinforce each other:

| Layer | What it does | Why it matters |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **MCP server** | Exposes 70+ `tokensave_*` tools to Claude | Claude can query the graph directly |
| **CLAUDE.md rules** | Tells Claude to prefer tokensave over agents/file reads | Prevents the model from falling back to expensive patterns |
| **PreToolUse hook** | Native Rust hook blocks Explore agents | Catches cases where the model ignores the CLAUDE.md rules |
| **UserPromptSubmit hook** | Runs at prompt submission | Lifecycle tracking for token accounting |
| **Stop hook** | Runs when the session ends | Flushes token counters |

The result: Claude gets the same code understanding with far fewer tokens. A typical Explore agent reads 20-50 files; tokensave returns the relevant symbols, relationships, and code snippets from its pre-built index.

---

## Network Calls & Privacy

tokensave's core functionality (indexing, search, graph queries, MCP server) is **100% local** -- your code never leaves your machine.

| Call | Data sent | When | Opt-out |
|------|-----------|------|---------|
| Worldwide counter upload | Token count (a number) + country (from IP) | sync, status, MCP sessions | `tokensave disable-upload-counter` |
| Worldwide counter read | Nothing (GET request) | status | N/A (read-only, 1s timeout) |
| Version check | Nothing (GET request) | status (cached 5m), sync (parallel) | N/A (1s timeout, no-op on failure) |
| Model pricing refresh | Nothing (GET request) | `tokensave cost` (cached 24h) | N/A (5s timeout, falls back to embedded pricing) |

The worldwide counter upload sends a single HTTP POST with a JSON body like `{"amount": 4823}`. No cookies, no tracking, no user ID. The Cloudflare Worker logs the country of your IP address (derived from request headers) for aggregate geographic statistics -- your actual IP address is not stored.

The model pricing refresh fetches a public JSON file from GitHub (`raw.githubusercontent.com/BerriAI/litellm/main/model_prices_and_context_window.json`) to keep Claude model pricing up to date for `tokensave cost`. No data is sent -- it is a plain HTTPS GET. The response is cached at `~/.tokensave/pricing.json` for 24 hours. If the fetch fails, tokensave uses its compiled-in pricing table.

---

## 50+ Languages

tokensave supports more than 50 programming languages organized into three tiers controlled by Cargo feature flags. Each tier includes all languages from the tier below it. Markdown headers are extracted as `Module` nodes with hierarchical `Contains` edges so document structure participates in graph queries alongside source code.

### Lite -- `--no-default-features`

```

All extractors share the same depth: functions, classes, methods, fields, imports, call graphs, inheritance chains, docstrings, complexity metrics, decorator/annotation extraction, and cross-file dependency tracking.

## tokensave vs CodeGraph

tokensave is a ground-up Rust rewrite of [CodeGraph](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@colbymchenry/codegraph) (Node.js/TypeScript). Both build semantic code graphs for AI coding agents, but they diverge significantly in scope and capabilities.

| | **tokensave** | **CodeGraph** |
|---|---|---|
| **Runtime** | Native binary (Rust) | Node.js 18+ |
| **Install** | `brew install`, `cargo install`, `scoop install` | `npx @colbymchenry/codegraph` |
| **Languages** | 50+ (3 tiers: lite/medium/full) | 19+ |
| **MCP tools** | 70+ | 9 |
| **Agent integrations** | 12+ (Claude, Codex, Gemini, OpenCode, Cursor, Cline, Copilot, Roo Code, Zed, Antigravity, Kilo, Kiro, Kimi, Vibe) | 1 (Claude Code) |
| **Index freshness** | On-demand staleness check on every MCP call; catch-up sync on connect; multi-agent work expected to use git worktrees | Native OS-level file watcher (FSEvents/inotify/ReadDirectoryChangesW, 2 s debounce); catch-up sync on connect |
| **Multi-branch indexing** | Yes, opt-in (per-branch DBs, cross-branch diff/search) | No |
| **Complexity metrics** | AST-extracted (branches, loops, nesting depth, cyclomatic) | No |
| **Porting tools** | Yes (`port_status`, `port_order`) | No |
| **Graph visualizer** | Removed (v4.0.1) | Yes |
| **Semantic search** | Agent-driven keyword expansion (zero-cost) | Local embeddings (nomic-embed-text-v1.5 via ONNX) |
| **MCP resources** | 4 (status, files, overview, branches) | No |
| **MCP annotations** | Yes (readOnlyHint, alwaysLoad) | No |
| **Dead code detection** | Yes | No |
| **Circular dependency detection** | Yes | No |
| **Type hierarchy** | Yes | No |
| **God class / coupling analysis** | Yes | No |
| **Commit / PR context** | Yes | No |
| **Test mapping** | Yes | No |
| **Rename preview** | Yes | No |
| **Token tracking** | Per-call metrics, live TUI monitor, session + lifetime counters | No |
| **Code-health analytics** | Composite score, Gini, dependency depth, DSM, risk-weighted test gaps, session deltas | No |
| **Edit primitives** | 4 atomic writers (`str_replace`, `multi_str_replace`, `insert_at`, `ast_grep_rewrite`) with auto re-indexing | No |
| **Crash resilience** | Subprocess-isolated extraction; native grammar aborts skip the file, sync continues | No |
| **Self-upgrade** | `tokensave upgrade` with stable/beta channels | `npm update` |
| **DB engine** | libsql (SQLite fork, WAL, async) | better-sqlite3 / wa-sqlite (WASM) |
| **Indexing speed** | ~1.2s for 1,782 files | ~4s for 1,782 files |
| **Binary size** | ~25 MB (all grammars bundled) | ~80 MB (node_modules + WASM) |

CodeGraph pioneered the approach and remains a solid choice if you prefer npm tooling and only need Claude Code integration. tokensave extends the concept with deeper analysis, more agents, multi-branch support, and a native binary with no runtime dependencies.

For detailed comparisons against CodeGraph, Dual-Graph (GrapeRoot), code-review-graph, and OpenWolf, see [docs/COMPARABLE-TOOLS.md](docs/COMPARABLE-TOOLS.md).

## Why tokensave Over the Alternatives

Several tools reduce token usage for AI coding agents. Here's why tokensave stands apart.

### Single native binary, zero dependencies

Every alternative requires a runtime: Python, Node.js, or both. tokensave ships as a single ~25 MB Rust binary with all 50+ tree-sitter grammars bundled. Nothing else to install.

### Deepest code intelligence

tokensave works at the symbol level: functions, structs, fields, call edges, type hierarchies, complexity metrics. Alternatives like Dual-Graph (GrapeRoot) work at the file level -- they know which files exist but can't answer "who calls this function?" or "what breaks if I change this struct?" tokensave's 70+ specialized MCP tools cover call graph traversal, impact analysis, dead code detection, test mapping, rename preview, type hierarchies, circular dependency detection, complexity ranking, code-health analytics (Gini, DSM, dependency depth, risk-weighted test gaps), atomic edit primitives, and more. The closest competitor (code-review-graph) has 22 tools; others have 5-9.

### Broadest agent support

More than a dozen AI coding agent integrations with per-agent native configuration formats. No other tool covers as many agents with as deep an integration. Claude Code gets hooks, prompt rules, and auto-allowed tool permissions. Kiro gets global MCP config, `tokensave.md` steering loaded as a resource, a managed agent with permissive built-in/tokensave tool approval, and hooks for delegation guardrails plus post-write sync. Other agents get MCP server registration in their native config format.

### Multi-branch indexing

The only tool in this space with optional per-branch graph databases and cross-branch diff and search. When enabled, switching branches is instant -- no re-indexing required.

### Per-call token tracking

The only tool that reports exactly how many tokens each individual MCP tool call saved, plus a live TUI monitor across all projects and lifetime counters.

### Fully open source

MIT-licensed Rust, auditable end to end. Dual-Graph's core engine (`graperoot` on PyPI) is proprietary -- you can't see what it does with your code graph. OpenWolf is AGPL-3.0, which requires derivative works to be open-sourced.

### Performance

Full-index benchmark on a 1,782-file mixed Rust/Java/Scala codebase (57K nodes, 103K edges):

| Tool | Time | Speedup |
|---|---|---|
| CodeGraph (TypeScript) | 31.2s | 1x |
| **tokensave (Rust)** | **1.2s** | **26x** |

---

## Troubleshooting

### "tokensave not initialized"

The `.tokensave/` directory doesn't exist in your project.

```bash
tokensave init
```

### MCP server not connecting

The AI agent doesn't see tokensave tools.

1. Ensure the agent config includes the tokensave MCP server (run `tokensave doctor`)
2. Restart the agent completely
3. Check that `tokensave` is in your PATH: `which tokensave`

### Missing symbols in search

- Run `tokensave sync` to update the index
- Check that the language is supported (see table above)
- Verify the file isn't excluded by `.gitignore`

### Indexing is slow

Large projects take longer on the first full index.

- Subsequent runs use incremental sync and are much faster
- Use `tokensave sync` (not `--force`) for day-to-day updates
- Staleness is checked automatically on every MCP tool call while an agent is connected

### Disabling tokensave for specific projects

If a project is too large and tokensave uses too much RAM, you can disable it per-project by setting `DISABLE_TOKENSAVE=true` in the MCP server environment. The server exits cleanly without initializing.

**Claude Code** — add to your project's `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tokensave": {
      "command": "tokensave",
      "args": ["serve"],
      "env": {
        "DISABLE_TOKENSAVE": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Other agents** — set the environment variable in whatever config your agent uses to launch MCP servers.

You can also set it globally via the shell (`DISABLE_TOKENSAVE=true claude`), but this disables tokensave for every project in the session.

## Origin

This project is a Rust port of the original [CodeGraph](https://github.com/colbymchenry/codegraph) TypeScript implementation by [@colbymchenry](https://github.com/colbymchenry). The port maintains the same architecture and MCP tool interface while leveraging Rust for performance and native tree-sitter bindings.

## Building

```bash
cargo build --release                          # full (50+ languages, default)
cargo build --release --features medium        # medium tier
cargo build --release --no-default-features    # lite (smallest binary)

cargo test                                     # run all tests (requires full)
cargo check --no-default-features              # verify lite compiles
cargo clippy --all
```
