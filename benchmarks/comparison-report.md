Side-by-side comparison on real-world Python repositories. Both tools index
the same clone, and the same random sample of symbols (seed=42) is used for
query timing so the find_symbol column is directly comparable.

**Memory notes.** token-savior's peak memory is measured with `tracemalloc`
(Python heap only). tokensave runs as a subprocess, so its peak is the
`ru_maxrss` delta from `getrusage(RUSAGE_CHILDREN)` (resident set size).
These are *not* identical units — treat them as order-of-magnitude.

**Query timing.** token-savior is called in-process (pure Python dict
lookups). tokensave is driven over MCP via `tokensave serve --timings`
and the per-query column reports the handler's `_meta.duration_us` —
i.e. the time spent inside the Rust handler, with JSON-RPC / stdio /
Python-parse overhead stripped out. A warm-up call is issued before
each timed loop. `get_change_impact` for tokensave sums the handler
times of `search → impact`, mirroring how an agent must resolve the
symbol to a node_id before querying.
