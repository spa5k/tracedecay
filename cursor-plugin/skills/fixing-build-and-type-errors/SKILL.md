name: fixing-build-and-type-errors
description: Turn compiler/type-checker errors into graph-anchored fixes. Runs the project type-checker (cargo check / tsc / pyright) or parses pasted cargo output, maps each diagnostic to the enclosing symbol with callers attached, then guides the fix. Use for "fix the build", "why won't this compile", "resolve type errors", or triaging cargo/clippy output.

# Fixing build & type errors

User-triggered because it can **run the toolchain**. Only start a build when the user asks; respect Cursor approval/run-mode.

## Workflow

1. **Run the checker → `tokensave_diagnostics`** (`scope`: `workspace` (default) | `package` (needs `name`) | `file` (needs `path`)): structured errors/warnings, each mapped to the enclosing graph node. Forces target dir `.tokensave/target/`; the **first** run on a fresh tree can take minutes, later calls are sub-second.
2. **Already have raw output? → `tokensave_diagnose`** (`cargo_output` required, `severity?`: `error`|`warning`|`all`, `include_callers?`, `max_diagnostics?`): paste full `cargo check`/`clippy`/`rustc` stderr; each diagnostic maps to the smallest containing node with up to 5 callers pre-attached. No toolchain run — cheap and safe.
3. **Understand the failing code:** resolve/inspect with the `tokensave:searching-for-code` ladder; widen blast radius with `tokensave_impact` if a fix is risky.
4. **Apply the fix → `tokensave:atomic-code-edits`** (or your normal edit tools).
5. **Re-check** with step 1, then verify behavior via `tokensave:running-impacted-tests`.

## Guardrails

- `tokensave_diagnostics` runs `cargo`/`tsc`/`pyright` and is the only heavyweight call here; `tokensave_diagnose` only parses text you provide — prefer it when you already captured the output.
- `tokensave_diagnostics` is multi-language (cargo/tsc/pyright); `tokensave_diagnose` is Rust/cargo-specific.

## Output

- The grouped diagnostics with enclosing symbols + callers, the applied fix, and a clean re-check.
- If any result includes a `tokensave_metrics:` line, report the savings to the user.
