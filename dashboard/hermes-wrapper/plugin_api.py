"""TraceDecay dashboard plugin for Hermes — tracedecay-backed API routes.

Mounted at /api/plugins/tracedecay/ by the Hermes dashboard plugin system.

This is a THIN reverse proxy onto the canonical implementation: a local
``tracedecay dashboard`` HTTP server (see the tracedecay repo, ``src/dashboard``).
It does not reimplement any data access. The wrapper:

- lazily spawns ``tracedecay dashboard --port 0`` bound to 127.0.0.1 (or uses
  an externally managed server via ``TRACEDECAY_DASHBOARD_URL``,
  with ``TOKENSAVE_DASHBOARD_URL`` as a legacy fallback),
- forwards ``/holographic/*`` -> upstream ``/api/plugins/holographic/*``,
  ``/lcm/*`` -> upstream ``/api/plugins/hermes-lcm/*``,
  ``/graph/*`` -> upstream ``/api/plugins/graph/*``, and
  ``/savings/*`` -> upstream ``/api/plugins/savings/*``,
- exposes upstream ``/api/capabilities`` at ``/capabilities`` so the UI (and
  future Hermes-specific extensions) can feature-detect the backend.

Auth: requests inherit the Hermes dashboard session-token middleware (this
router is mounted under ``/api/plugins/...``); the upstream tracedecay server
only listens on loopback.

Configuration (environment always wins, then deploy-time defaults below):

- ``TRACEDECAY_DASHBOARD_URL``      use an existing server instead of spawning
  (legacy fallback: ``TOKENSAVE_DASHBOARD_URL``).
- ``TRACEDECAY_BIN``                path to the tracedecay binary
  (legacy fallback: ``TOKENSAVE_BIN``).
- ``TRACEDECAY_DASHBOARD_PROJECT``  project root to serve (must be
  ``tracedecay init``-ed); defaults to the Hermes process cwd
  (legacy fallback: ``TOKENSAVE_DASHBOARD_PROJECT``).

Hermes-only extension: ``POST /curation/llm-plan`` layers LLM-based curation
(ported from the holographic_plus curator's one-shot review tier) on top of
the tracedecay server, which itself only does similarity math. See the
"LLM curation" section below.

# LLM curation (Hermes-only layer)
#
# Ported from plugins/memory/holographic_plus/curator.py's one-shot LLM review
# tier (`_call_llm_oneshot` + `_LLM_SYSTEM_PROMPT` + `_extract_json_plan`),
# adapted to the tracedecay curation contract:
#
#   POST <upstream>/api/plugins/holographic/curate/apply
#     {"ops": [{"op": "delete", "fact_id": int, "reason"?: str}
#              | {"op": "merge", "winner_id": int, "loser_ids": [int],
#                 "merged_content"?: str}]}
#
# tracedecay has no archive state (curation hard-deletes), so the original
# verdict vocabulary is narrowed: merge stays merge; supersede becomes a
# delete of the stale fact; reflect (time-aware consolidation) becomes a
# merge with `merged_content`; recategorize/retag have no contract op and are
# out of scope here. The duplicate/conflict policy text is kept verbatim in
# spirit: only act on same-subject same-claim facts, conservative by default.
#
# Flow (POST /curation/llm-plan):
#   1. Fetch similar pairs from the tracedecay server (`/similarity`) and
#      cluster them (union-find over shared fact ids).
#   2. One LLM call via Hermes' auxiliary client (task="memory_curator", the
#      same task key the original curator used, so provider/model resolution
#      matches), temperature=0, strict-JSON response.
#   3. Validate proposed ops against the reviewed cluster ids (the original's
#      evidence guard) and an optional confidence floor.
#   4. dry_run=true (default): return the plan for UI preview.
#      dry_run=false: POST the contract-shaped ops to the tracedecay apply
#      endpoint and return its per-op results alongside the plan.
